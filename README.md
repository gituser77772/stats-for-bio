This is the course book for the Data Analysis in R course applied to biological examples. The course has orginally been based out of the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheffield and extended for the University of Canberra and other tutoring arrangements. 

## Resources

It is written using R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

## Notes for the author

This project combines a collection of tools and packages used in R and RStudio for statistical analysis. Each class or short project can be found in the ... folder. Currrently we have setup the following projects...

- Setup and running the pipeline of tools.....

### Setup

The project folder is hosted on `github` in a private repository that we are both collaborators on. 

## Simple options

There are a collection of tools needed to connect all the different software and open source resources that make this possible. They are:

##### R

This is the statistical program that runs all of the work with numbers and other analysis/visualisations.

#### RStudio

The interactive interface for R. Also known as a GUI.

#### GIT

The version control system commonly used for computer programming projects.

#### GIThub

The file storage system for GIT. This is an online repository and file storage system.

##### You can just download a zip file of the repository "as is" by:

##### Or you can "fork" the repository and work like I have here in the demo I quickly recorded using visual studio code to work with the `git` repository.

#### Typora

A great markdown editor (a way of viewing and editing text files for the internet and other things).

I also like using the text editor here (Typora) for adding quick notes and screenshots.

### Working with this book

*   Do not place files in any directory ending in "_files". This will get moved into "_bookdown_files" and will not be tracked by git. At least this was true in an earlier version of bookdown, maybe fixed now...
